TODO List
To put together a few of the things we’ve learned in this lecture, let’s work on making a TODO list entirely in JavaScript. We’ll start by writing the HTML layout of the page. Notice below how we leave space for an unorderd list, but we dont yet add anything to it. Also notice that we add a link to tasks.js where we’ll write our JavaScript.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Tasks</title>
        <script src="tasks.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Tasks</h1>
        <ul id="tasks"></ul>
        <form>
            <input id="task" placeholder = "New Task" type="text">
            <input id="submit" type="submit">
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
